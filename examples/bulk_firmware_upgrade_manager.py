Cisco Meraki Bulk Firmware Upgrade Manager
John M. Kuchta .:|:.:|:.  https://github.com/TKIPisalegacycipher
This script will pull network IDs from an org and then create asynchronous action batches. Each batch will contain, for 
each network, an action that will either schedule a new upgrade, or delay an existing upgrade datetime stamp by X days
(configurable). Each batch can contain up to 100 actions, therefore, each batch can modify up to 100 networks. 

As always, you should read the docs before diving in. If you know how these features work, then it will be easier to 
understand and leverage this tool.

Firmware upgrades endpoint: https://developer.cisco.com/meraki/api-v1/#!get-network-firmware-upgrades
Action batches: https://developer.cisco.com/meraki/api-v1/#!action-batches-overview

NB: Once you start the script, there are no confirmation prompts or previews, so test in a lab if necessary. 

NB: When the final batch has been submitted, depending on the batch size, it may take a few minutes to finish. Feeling 
creative? Then try extending this script (using existing code, for the most part) to confirm when the batches are 
complete. Feeling super creative? Wrap this behind a Flask frontend and have yourself a merry little GUI.
